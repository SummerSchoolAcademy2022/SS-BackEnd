# SS-BackEnd

### Prerequisites
* JDK 17
* Intellij Idea
* Maven

### Cloning the BE Repo
You can clone the BE project using the command: git clone https://github.com/SummerSchoolAcademy2022/SS-BackEnd.git

### Ways of working
* When starting to work on a story, you need to get the latest changes from the main branch and create a new branch from it
  * git checkout main
  * git fetch 
  * git pull
  * git checkout -b story/{name}
* After you finish the changes, you can raise a Pull Request and you need two approvals before merging the PR in the main branch
* If you have two approvals and your changes are working as expected, you can merge the Pull Request
* Apart from testing your changes locally, you also need to create unit tests in order to cover the edge cases as well and to make sure your code doesn't break in the future
